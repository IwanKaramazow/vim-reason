vim-reason:
=========================================

Version of
[vim-reason-legacy](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/vim-reason-legacy) that
uses Merlin's newer protocol.

This is good for testing the new Merlin protocol and finding issues with
bleeding edge merlin. It also helps determine if issues we see with LSP are
merely due to using the older merlin protocol.

For a more supported plugin, use
[vim-reason-plus](https://github.com/reasonml-editor/vim-reason-plus) which
uses an LSP bridge.
